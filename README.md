The code within this repository was utilized in the completion of my Master's Thesis entitled "Implementation of Obstacle Avoidance Algorithms for Underwater Multi-Robot Systems." The accompanying documentation is available in the file named "AntoniRajaMateosTFM_MUSI.pdf."

The following video demonstrates the behavior of two Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) when encountering obstacles, employing the Artificial Potential Fields (APF) algorithm:

Additionally, presented is a multi-robot system composed of AUVs navigating using the Artificial Potential Fields (APF) algorithm, Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA), and the Stop-and-Wait (SAW) strategy:

The main code file implementing the collision avoidance algorithms and the stop-and-wait strategy is located at src/C_A.py.
